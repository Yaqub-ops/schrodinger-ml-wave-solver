# Numerical and ML-Based Wave Equation Solver

This project implements a finite-difference solver for eigenvalue problems
associated with second-order differential operators and explores the use
of neural networks as surrogate models for eigenvalue and eigenfunction prediction.

## Methods
- Finite difference discretization of differential operators
- Numerical eigenvalue solvers
- Neural networks trained on numerically generated data

## Relevance
The methods used are directly applicable to wave propagation problems
in physics and geophysics, including seismology.

## Tools
Python, NumPy, SciPy, PyTorch, Matplotlib
